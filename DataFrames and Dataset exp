DataFrame:

                    Distributed collection of data organized into named columns (like a database table).

                    Built on top of RDDs with schema and query optimization.

                    Balances structured data handling and distributed computation.

Features

                ✅ Schema Support – structured columns with defined data types.

                ✅ High-Level API – supports SQL queries, filters, aggregations, joins, etc.

                ✅ Query Optimization – uses Catalyst Optimizer.

                ✅ In-Memory Processing – allows caching for faster execution.

Advantages

            🔹 Easier to use with structured data.

            🔹 Optimized for performance.

            🔹 Reduces code complexity with a high-level API.

Disadvantages

               ⚠️ Limited control over low-level transformations.

               ⚠️ Less flexible compared to RDDs.

Dataset

         Extension of DataFrame with type safety and object-oriented programming.

         Combines RDD type-safety with DataFrame performance optimizations.

         Provides compile-time error checking and optimized execution.

Features

        ✅ Type-Safe – ensures compile-time type safety.

        ✅ Optimized Execution – uses Catalyst Optimizer.

        ✅ Rich APIs – supports functional and relational transformations.

Advantages

             🔹 Combines DataFrame performance with RDD safety.

             🔹 Ideal for developers who need strong typing and complex transformations.

Disadvantages

              ⚠️ Limited support in PySpark (mainly for Scala/Java).

              ⚠️ Adds unnecessary complexity if DataFrames are sufficient.
