 Apache Spark – Features Summary Table

Feature	                                              Purpose / Description	                                                                  Key Benefit
1. Swift Processing	                          Uses in-memory computing to minimize disk I/O and speed up data processing.	                Up to 100× faster than Hadoop; enables real-time and batch efficiency.
2. Dynamic & Versatile Operations            	Provides 80+ high-level operators for easy transformations and actions.	                    Simplifies complex workflows like ETL, analytics, ML, etc.
3. In-Memory Computation	                    Stores intermediate results in memory instead of writing to disk.                          	Boosts performance for iterative and repeated computations.
4. Reusability Across Workloads	              Same framework for batch, streaming, and interactive processing.	                          Enables code reusability and simplifies multi-use workloads.
5. Fault Tolerance	                          Uses RDD lineage to automatically recover lost data after node failure.	                    Ensures reliable, fault-tolerant execution.
6. Real-Time Stream Processing               	Handles real-time data streams via Spark Streaming (micro-batches).	                        Enables low-latency analytics for use cases like fraud detection and IoT.
7. Lazy Evaluation                          	Builds a logical execution plan before performing actions.                                 	Optimizes performance by avoiding unnecessary computations.
8. Polyglot Support	                          Supports Python, Scala, Java, and R with interactive shells.                               	Increases developer accessibility and flexibility.
9. Support for Advanced Analytics            	Integrates libraries – Spark SQL, MLlib, GraphX, Spark Streaming.	                          Provides a complete analytics ecosystem within one framework.
10. Integration with Hadoop                  	Works with HDFS, Hive, HBase, and can run on YARN.	                                        Seamless integration with existing Hadoop infrastructure.
