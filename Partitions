RDD Partitions in Apache Spark

1. Definition

            RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) are divided into smaller logical chunks called partitions.
            
            Each partition represents a subset of data processed independently and in parallel.
            
            Partitioning is fundamental to Sparkâ€™s ability to perform distributed and parallel computation efficiently.


2. Purpose of Partitioning

            Enables parallel processing across multiple nodes or cores.
            
            Ensures load distribution by dividing large datasets into smaller tasks.
            
            Improves performance and scalability by utilizing all available cluster resources.
            
            Provides fault toleranceâ€”each partition can be recomputed if lost.

3. Partitioning in Spark

        When creating an RDD using methods such as:
        
                        parallelize()
                        
                        textFile()
                        
                        wholeTextFiles()

Spark automatically determines the number of partitions based on:

                    The number of available cores
                    
                    The cluster configuration (in a distributed setup)

          ðŸ§  Example:
      
      rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 3)
      print(rdd.getNumPartitions())  # Output: 3


4. Default Partitioning Behavior
                    Method                      	Behavior
                    parallelize()	              Splits data into partitions based on system cores or specified number.
                    textFile()	                  Automatically partitions data depending on file size and cluster configuration.
                    wholeTextFiles()              	Each file typically becomes one partition.
                    Default Rule	               On a single machine, number of partitions â‰ˆ number of CPU cores.
5. Key Points

Each partition is the smallest unit of parallel execution in Spark.

            Too few partitions â†’ low parallelism (underutilization).
            
            Too many partitions â†’ overhead in scheduling tasks.

Partitioning can be customized using:

                  repartition(n) â†’ increases/decreases number of partitions.
                  
                  coalesce(n) â†’ merges partitions to optimize performance.
